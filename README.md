# 2D Boss Fight Game – Rage System Prototype

A 2D boss fight prototype inspired by *Hollow Knight*.

This project focuses on designing a responsive combat system and experimenting with a unique rage mechanic driven by real-time microphone input.

## Core Features

- State machine–based player and boss behavior
- Boss with multiple attack patterns (lunge, jump slam, claw)
- Rage system activated by microphone volume input
- Dynamic stat modification during Rage Mode:
  - Increased attack damage
  - Increased movement speed
  - Health regeneration
- Physics-based combat using Unity Rigidbody system

## Technical Focus

This project was built to practice:

- Finite State Machine (FSM) architecture
- Implemented core systems independently without AI-assisted code generation to strengthen problem-solving and debugging skills
- Clean combat logic structuring
- Unity physics and collision handling
- Real-time audio input processing
- Boss pattern design and balancing

## Project Status

Core combat system and boss mechanics are complete.  
Currently refining balance and polishing gameplay feedback.

## Purpose

This project serves as a foundation for future game development experiments, including a potential Berserker-style Metroidvania concept expanding on the rage mechanic.
